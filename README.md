After formatting the date and cleaning, I exported data from MySQL. Anyone who wants to export from a direct .csv file may have issues with date formatting. On that case, he can do the following steps --
Transform Data> Power Query Editor>right click on order_date> change type>Text(This will change all the mixed text and date format to text)> Then again right click on order_date> change type>using locale>Data type=Date>Locale=English(World)>OK>Close and Apply. 
I am attaching two screenshots for anyone's convenience.
